# NSNSDAcoustics

This repository provides a place for NSNSD staff to modernize and modify several bioacoustics workflows in development, including,

1) `Wave_To_NVSPL`: a wrapper function for PAMGuide code that converts wave audio to NVSPLs.
2) `NVSPL_To_AI`: a function for converting NVSPL files into acoustic indices
3) The BirdNET function family: several functions for manipulation of [BirdNET data](https://www.birdnet.cornell.edu).

Contributors should clone this repository (set it up as an R project package) and connect it to GitHub (see [Happy Git with R](https://www.happygitwithr.com) for tips). While the package is in development, use the Build > Install and Restart buttons in RStudio to install the package locally on your machine.

The R script file `Intro-Demo.R` walks through a few basic workflow examples. **MORE INFO TO COME.**
